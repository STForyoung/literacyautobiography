While the exact number of Languages spoken in Cameroon is unknown, there are reports counting between 250 and 600 languages. I am half from the Mbei tribe and half from the Mendankwe tribe. These tribes are all found in the north west region of the Country. Apart from the Tribal languages, official languages in the Country are English and French.</p>

          <p class = "card-text">Growing up in the capital of Cameroon where English was a minor language, I spoke English at home and French out of home. I learned both languages through acquisition. As a kid, I grew up in an environment which was very interactive. Everyone cooperated with one-another. I always went out early in the morning to visit my friends and they all spoke fluent French. In this way I learned to speak French naturally. </p>

          <p class = "card-text">Soccer was a big sport in my country. If you wanted to be important among your friends you had to play good soccer. I grew up loving the sport and wanted to be a professional, but unfortunately things did not go as planned. My society made it difficult for me to chase my dream. To be successful, you had to either be a doctor or an engineer, so after going to boarding school for seven years I lost my ability to grow and play soccer, but I picked up new interests. Just as Scribner says in the quote, the educational system is focused at gearing students towards picking the stereotypic jobs that will make them successful based on standards of their instructors or parents </p>

          <p class = "card-text">When I was eight, my mother came back from her travel to the US with a toy piano she got for me, and from that day, I began to learn how to play piano. I did not have a formal teacher but I spent a lot of time listening to other people who played. Because I am a Christian, I spent most of my time playing at my church. The people who I learned from acted as scaffoldings for me because they showed me just the necessary things I needed to know to improve my learning. Knowing how to play piano has proven to be one of the best things that happened to me. I usually find a lot of purpose.</p>

          <p class = "card-text">When I moved to the United States, I had to cope with the fact that I spoke a form of English which was different form that spoken by others. People sometimes asked me to repeat what I said because they could not hear me clearly. I felt like I had to adjust my way of speaking to fit the “dominant discourse.” Although I have shaped the way I speak for those who cannot easily hear me, I still retain my original accent whenever I speak to someone from my home or Country of origin. Language is a sensitive matter for many people. Many times I have had bad experiences where people marginalize the way I express myself, but I believe that I find my pride in the way I express myself. It is part of who I am. </p>

          <p class = "card-text">Everyone expects someone studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley to go ahead and get a good job and start making money. In my opinion, I need to find purpose in whatever I am doing. I do not know what I will see out in the industry but I need to figure out what aligns with my beliefs and my purpose; not just seeking money. One of my main goals is to be able to impart some of the literacy skills I have caught to younger people, whether it is the teaching piano, programming or lifestyle skills. I think by helping other people, one is actually engaging in a behavioral literacy. Going out into the world exposes a person to many different situations the person can learn from. I believe that there is still a lot of adventure out there for me and I hope I can make the most of it.</p>
